# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
a = 16
print(bin(a))
~~~

## Output
<img width="1181" height="267" alt="442892759-23e036bf-9310-495e-8883-0a068b5cece1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31fb8f1d-09ba-42eb-aaab-ad593c2ee264" />

## Result
The program successfully converts the number 16 into its binary representation and prints it.
